Step into a world of customization where every piece of clothing shapes your character. Visit the shopkeeper to browse, buy, and sell outfits, then mix and match pieces to assemble your unique look. Manage your wardrobe, experiment with different combinations, and bring your character to life.

This game was originally developed as part of a selection process to evaluate technical skillsâ€”and it got the job done.
